Results Fetcher
===============

Instead of fetching one result at a time, script allows you to fetch multiple roll numbers(given in range) and display the results


Usage
-----

You simply need to modify these variables:

`$roll_len={Roll number length};`

`$url='{url where post requests are to be sent}';`
